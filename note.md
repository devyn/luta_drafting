# Luta notes

## Efficiency and Technology

- Using LÃ–VE engine
- Small packets [as small as practically possible]
- Game hosted in the cloud, give rewards for donating server time
- Uses 'zones'. Maps are huge, and they're divided. Multiple instances (channels) may exist. Server can rezone whenever it wants to. This is done either to make up for a server disconnection, or to relieve stress.
- Use 'groups' to ensure everyone stays on the same channel. Also has a few other benefits, like shared EXP and money.

## Gameplay

- No "job advancements". Instead, many jobs, and **rank**.
- Rank is earned by doing quests. EXP is earned by hunting.
- Rank gives benefits such as titles, skills, and items.
- Level gives stat benefits (Health, Energy, Strength, etc.)
- Jobs can be switched in any town throughout the game, for a rank penalty to the previous job. Rank is job-dependent. Therefore, you can train a Crossbow-man job to a very high level (ex. rank 19 042), yet be low down in the Thief job (ex. rank 128).
- There are Melee, Charge, Block, and Skill attacks. Melee, Charge & Block are also skills, and they are job-dependent. They can be trained just as any other skill.
- Using a skill regularly and effectively will gain you training in it. Skills will level up as you become more proficient in them, giving added effectiveness.
- Skills can be activated using the Quickslot (q w e r a s d f) or the bottom panel
- Equip items can give skills and stats. An axe may provide the Melee skill (override), and a shield may provide, say, +50 Vitality +20 Defense and the Block skill (again, override).

## Art style

- HQ software synth music. Genres: Techno, Rock, Metal, Medieval
- Thick, curvy, black-outlined cartoon graphics. [Think: Paper Mario]
- Very colorful, but not too vivid. Monochromatic schemes are common for single objects.
- Antialiasing!!!! Yes, no icky pixel stairs. Smooth curves abound. (lol, not dissing pixel art styles though, I love those too but it's been done too much for this type of game. I want a 2D MMORPG that's *not* pixel-art. Truly though, I love Cave Story and various [S]NES games, probably more.)

## Setting

- A highly evolved [futuristic, even] society built around mythical creatures and magic. Yes, I know this has been done lots before, but not like this. Trust me on this one. This aims to achieve cartoon realism (er, as realistic as a cartoon can be... ^_^)
- TODO: Evolve the setting and story further.

## Interface & Graphics

- will scale to any native resolution
- has a big ribbon bar at the bottom with stats, $$$, minimap, a few buttons (quit and etc.), and quick windows (skills, character info, items, etc.)
- designed to work with a minimal amount of mouse usage.
- preeeety UI. lulz. do I even have to say? you should know me well enough by now.
